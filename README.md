# MineSwarmSimulator
The bee swarm minecraft mod

WARNING: This branch will not be updated until the 1.21.1 version is released.

DISCLAIMER: This repo is the only official place where you can download this mod.

## Current state of the mod
The mod is currently in pre-pre-pre-pre-pre alpha,
so don't expect a full release until at least a few months.

When it will release (someday), it will be available for fabric (also probably on Modrinth idk) on 1.21.1,
and maybe other versions if I have enough time to update the mod.

## Dependencies
Needs both Fabric API and Trinkets API to run properly
